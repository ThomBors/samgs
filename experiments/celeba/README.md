# CelebA Experiment

Modification of the code in [FAMO](https://github.com/Cranial-XIX/FAMO).

## Dataset

The dataset is available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pWEZsZE9oNnFzTm8?resourcekey=0-5BR16BdXnb8hVj6CNHKzLg). Put the downloaded files in `./dataset` so that the folder structure is `.dataset/train` and `./dataset/val`.   

## Evaluation

To align with previous work on MTL [Liu et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03792); we report the test performance based on the best validation results. Note that this is not handled in the code and need to be applied by the user.
